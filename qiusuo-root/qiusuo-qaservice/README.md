# Design of QA

(1)QA basically is about user posting a question. We actually only need the user name and user id. It's similar to making a post.
(2)People could have comments. It's perfectly well to use mongo db to achieve this function. It's not highly uninform. IT's not high performance
needed. So we will use mongo db to achieve this functionality.
